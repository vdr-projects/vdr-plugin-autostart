Description:

This PlugIn tries to identify the type of media inserted by removable devices 
like CD-ROM/DVD or USB sticks and starts the configured PlugIn and execute
configured key codes, so that a PlugIn can start without any user interaction. 

The configuration of the PlugIn is done in the file
$VDRCONFIG/conf/plugins/autostart/autostart.conf. A sample autostart.conf looks
like (see also in the contrib directory):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; The global section contains definitions global to all detectors
[GLOBAL]
; exclude the given devices from media detection, e.g. the root hard drives
filterdev = sda sdb hda hdb
[DVD]
type = dvd   ; DVD Media tester
keys = @externalplayer OK
[CD]
type = cd           ; CD Media tester
keys = @cdplayer    ; Start CD-Player plugin
[MP3]
type = file             ; File Media tester
files = mp3             ; Suffix to match 
keys = @music YELLOW    ; If a file ending with .mp3 is found, start music plugin
linkpath = /video/mount/mp3
[IMG]
type = file             ; File Media tester
files = jpg gif bmp     ; If a file ends with .jpg .gif or .bmp, start image plugin
keys = @image YELLOW DOWN RED RED
linkpath = /video/mount/image
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keywords common to all media testers:

TYPE defines an instance of a media tester. Currently the following media 
testers are available: 

* DVD   : Recognizes video DVDs via libdvdread.
* CD    : Detects audio CDs via libcdio.
* FILE  : Mounts a removable media and try to detect file types according the
          suffix.
          
KEY defines the PlugIn and key codes, which shall be executed when a media
type is detected. The @ indicates a PlugIn name. So the 
"keys = @externalplayer OK" line means, start PlugIn externalplayer and press
the OK key.

Keywords for the FILE-media tester:

FILES:     Suffix for which this tester shall test.
LINKPATH:  Create a symbolic link from the automatic mounted directory to a 
           fixed location. For example in the section [MP3] for an inserted 
           USB-Stick, which contains files with the suffix mp3, mounted to
           /media/USB-Stick "linkpath = /video/mount/mp3" will create a link
           from /media/USB-Stick to /video/mount/mp3
          
For the above example, which starts the music PlugIn for mp3 files, the 
corresponding musicsources.conf should look like:

/video/mount/mp3;USB-Stick;0;*.mp3/*.ogg/*.wav/*.MP3/*.OGG/*.WAV/*.m3u/*.M3U/*.pls/*.PLS
/video/mp3;MP3;0;*.mp3/*.ogg/*.wav/*.MP3/*.OGG/*.WAV/*.m3u/*.M3U/*.pls/*.PLS

And the imagesources.conf for the image PlugIn:

/video/images; Bilder;0; *.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.tif* *.bmp
/video/mount/image; USB; 0; *.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.tif* *.bmp
